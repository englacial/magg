"""Generic vlen (variable-length record) reader primitives (issue #425).

Three sensor-agnostic declarative primitives extend the reader grammar so
vlen-packed products (GEDI L1B ``rxwaveform``, LVIS, any future waveform
sensor) are pure config — no sensor module (ruling on issue #422):

- **ragged gather** — the base level is a flat sample array tiled by a coarse
  (record) level's origin-aware ``link`` (``index_beg``/``count``/
  ``index_base``). GEDI's ``rx_sample_start_index`` is origin-1, the exact
  ``index_base: 1`` precedent of ATL03 ``ph_index_beg``. Planned reads slice
  the flat array by the record link, so only the shard's records are decoded.
- **expand** — per-record scalars repeat by sample count to base rate.
  Coordinates declare it with ``data_source.coordinates.level: <record
  level>`` (the base level carries no native coordinates); per-record
  variables reuse the existing segment-level ``variables`` broadcast
  (:func:`zagg.processing.read._read_segment_broadcasts`).
- **coordinate synthesis** — a per-sample column computed as
  ``linspace(start, stop, count)`` within each record: a
  ``data_source.variables`` entry of the mapping form
  ``{synthesize: linspace, level: <record level>, start: <path>, stop:
  <path>}`` (GEDI per-sample elevation from the per-shot
  ``elevation_bin0``/``elevation_lastbin`` endpoints).

After expansion each sample is an ordinary point observation; everything
downstream of the returned columns (filters, aggregation, write) is untouched.
Split out of ``read.py`` per the §4 module cap (the route would push it past
1,200 lines); the shared helpers are imported from there.

    Asset variables degrade to NaN columns — unlike asset filters, which fail
    closed (:func:`_sibling_record_mask`): a quality gate must never pass
    unverified records silently, but a missing companion column is recoverable
    downstream (and an expression filter over it drops the NaN rows by plain
    comparison semantics). The read runs once per beam group; the guard rides
    the granule's open primary handle so eight groups warn once, not eight
    times.

    Only a VARIABLE-ONLY asset reaches here: :func:`_sibling_joins` raises for
    an asset carrying a filter before this is called, so a config declaring
    both on one asset (the shipped gedi01b template's ``l2a``) never warns —
    it fails the group.
