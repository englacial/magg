"""The ``inline`` index backend: chunk map built at read time (issue #160, phase 2).

Selection is identical to ``hierarchical`` (the coarse geolocation read +
``plan_read``); addressing goes through a per-granule **chunk map** built on
the fly by walking each dataset's v1 chunk B-tree with h5coro — pure Python,
metadata-only, ~1 ranged GET + tens of ms per granule (the B-trees live in
the front-of-file metadata block NSIDC keeps inside h5coro's first cache
line; measured on PR #159's ``bench/offsets`` route (b), cross-validated
there against h5py and hidefix chunk-for-chunk over 61 granules with zero
mismatches). Decode goes through the compiled h5coro-hidefix reader (issue
#170): the chunk map reconstructs a per-dataset in-memory ``Index`` whose
``read_from_buffers`` inflates exactly the covering chunks, byte-identical
to h5py/h5coro, with the GIL released. Both read routes are served — the
planned (chunk-aligned hyperslice) route for sources with
``read_plan.spatial_index``, and the full-read route for read-plan-less
(flat) sources — so this backend is the package default for every data
source. Datasets the compiled reader cannot serve degrade to the h5coro
decoder per dataset, where the chunk map still lets reads that start
exactly on an interior chunk boundary be detected and shifted one element
early (see below).

The chunk map is also the write-back payload: with ``write_back: true``
(opt-in — issue #160 Q2) plus a ``store``, every granule's accumulated chunk
maps are persisted as a granule-keyed parquet manifest
(``<store>/<granule_id>.parquet``, the PR #159 offsets schema plus the
per-dataset decode metadata) after its last group is read. That is how the
sidecar store gets populated before a ``sidecar`` backend can serve it (the
issue's deployment progression). Coverage defaults to **full** (issue #190):
the manifest carries chunk maps for *every* decodable dataset in the granule,
enumerated from the same front-of-file metadata the read already cached (no
extra chunk GETs), so one build serves any downstream config — the #163 store
design intent. ``write_back_coverage: lazy`` restores the old behavior
(persist only the datasets this run's planned reads touched) for a private
run that wants the smaller manifest.

Known h5coro quirk this backend must sidestep: a hyperslice starting exactly
on an interior chunk boundary (``k * chunk_len``, ``k > 0``) trips h5coro's
B-tree start-edge intersection off-by-one (found in PR #152, discussed on
issue #148) — chunk-aligned reads start one element early and trim.

    Metadata-only: no chunk is ever read or decompressed. A contiguous-layout
    dataset yields a single pseudo-chunk covering the full first axis
    (mirroring h5py's ``get_offset()`` treatment in the bench extractor).
    Cache lines the B-tree walk pulls into ``h5obj.cache`` are evicted before
    returning (issue #460); the lines the ``H5Dataset`` parse itself touched
    are deliberately kept (the snapshot is taken after the parse). Parse-line
    residency does grow per *distinct* dataset rather than being fully shared,
    but it is bounded by the group's object-header / metadata footprint, not by
    the chunk count: measured on a real GEDI L1B beam group (PR #462 evidence),
    a whole group's read left **11 lines / 46 MB** resident at the 4 MiB
    default — the data path's own lines included — out of **90 distinct lines**
    ever touched across the group, against the hundreds of MB the unevicted
    walks stranded. The absent-path ``KeyError`` below returns before the
    snapshot on purpose: nothing walk-touched exists yet, and its parse lines
    are retained by the same choice. That retention is exact only on the
    immediate path (single-threaded); the deferred path below drops some parse
    lines too, so the GEDI figure above — measured through it at the default
    ``read_workers`` — is if anything the lower residency of the two.

    ``evict_into`` defers that eviction for a caller whose builds run
    concurrently on one handle: pass a set and the walk's keys are *added* to
    it (a GIL-atomic ``set.update``) instead of popped, for the caller to
    evict once its fan-out has joined — see :func:`_evict_deferred_lines`.
    The window is a plain before/after key diff, so lines *other threads* add
    inside it are swept in as well — measurably, including other datasets'
    object-header parse lines (review finding on PR #462: 23 of 40 concurrent
    rounds on the test fixture). Those lines re-fetch on next touch (one small
    ranged read each), and that bounded cost is the deliberate price of a
    race-free drain: the alternative — subtracting a floor of every build's
    ``before`` snapshot — is extra machinery to protect what is a memory *win*.
    The default (``None``) evicts immediately, which is what every
    single-threaded caller wants (``_prebuild_group_maps``, the full-coverage
    walk, direct use).

    Raises ``KeyError`` for an absent path (h5coro's ``metaOnly`` traversal

        """Build the addressing seam: planned ranges, compiled decode.

        The chunk maps this backend already builds are exactly what
        ``h5coro_hidefix.Index.from_chunks`` consumes (the same
        ``granule_manifest`` columns ``write_back`` persists), so decode goes
        through the compiled reader (issue #170): plan the covering chunks,
        fetch their byte ranges through the worker's h5coro driver
        (``ioRequest`` — no second credential path), and inflate with
        ``read_from_buffers`` (byte-identical to h5py/h5coro, GIL released).
        Datasets the compiled route cannot serve — undecodable dtypes
        (strings, compounds), empty chunk maps, reconstruction failures —
        degrade to the h5coro decoder per dataset with a warning, never
        aborting the shard. The h5coro fallback keeps the PR #152 start-edge
        workaround: a range starting exactly on an interior chunk boundary
        is shifted one element early and trimmed (h5coro's B-tree start-edge
        intersection drops the chunk entirely); the compiled reader has
        exact ``[start, end)`` semantics and needs no workaround.

        Chunk maps are built lazily per dataset (first read of that path)
        and cached for the life of the returned callable — i.e. one
        ``read_group`` call, which is exactly one (granule, group): a group's
        datasets are disjoint from every other group's, so nothing is
        rebuilt or leaked across granules. Under ``write_back`` the cache is
        THIS granule's pending sub-dict instead (``_pending_for`` — keyed per
        granule so concurrent in-flight granules never interleave, issue
        #180), accumulating the granule's maps across groups for
        ``finish_granule`` to persist. Those lazy builds defer their cache-line
        eviction onto ``read_fn.deferred_lines`` (issue #460) because they run
        across the read pool's threads; ``read_group`` drains it once the route
        has joined. Each dataset gets
        its own single-dataset in-memory ``Index`` (~ms), so a spec hidefix
        rejects degrades that dataset alone.

        Selection-shaped reads skip the walk (issue #185): on the planned
        route a full-dataset read (``hyperslice is None``) is a segment-rate
        selection read — data reads arrive as hyperslices — and h5coro's
        ``readDatasets`` (4 MiB cache lines) serves those faster than the
        compiled route once the B-tree walk is priced in (the 0.18 inline
        regression, ~41% at ``granule_workers: 1``; the #170 matrix measured
        the same trade). So with ``write_back`` off, an unmapped full-dataset
        read on the planned route goes straight through ``readDatasets`` and
        builds no chunk map. A path already mapped (e.g. one that is both a
        data and a selection read) keeps the compiled route — the map is paid
        for. With ``write_back`` ON nothing changes: the walk's product IS
        the manifest payload, so selection datasets stay mapped (and served
        compiled) to keep manifests covering them for sidecar consumers. The
        full-read route (``planned=False``) is untouched — its compiled
        full-dataset decode is the point of issue #170.
